; Expects selected to point at a piece to move, and cursor to be on the target
; space.
; Many pieces can move any distance in a variety of directions, but are blocked
; by other pieces. The generic way to handle that is with a "ray", an index
; delta that we repeatedly evaluate until we either:
; - Hit the edge of the board,
; - Hit an ownside piece - illegal move.
; - Hit an enemy piece - legal capture, but if it's not the target space then
;   this ray has failed.
; Knights and pawns have very special rules. Kings move to a fixed set of
; spaces, which I just check directly.
